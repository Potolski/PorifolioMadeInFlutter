# My Portifolio Made in Flutter

This project started as a simple login page but then I got excited turned it into my portifolio made in flutter.

It contains the following screens:

- Simple screen with a text
- Main screen:

  - About me section
  - My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidpotolskilafeta) in a Web view
  - My [Github profile](https://github.com/Potolski) in a Web view
  - My [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@davidpotolskilafeta) in aweb view
  - My [rap albums' playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/DvD1697) on youtube

- Login screen with hardcoded auth (username: 123 and password: 302), connected to the Youtube screen

# Next Steps

- Add Spotify API support
- Create a sections that centralizes the rap stuff
- Write "About me" section
- Fix first page (Add more functionalities)
