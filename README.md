# Youtube copy

This project started as a simple login page but then I got excited and wanted to add youtube in the middle.

It contains 3 screens:

- Simple page with a text
- Youtube's mobile copy
- Login page with hardcoded auth (username: 123 and password: 302)

## Souces:

- [youtube_player_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_player_flutter)
- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)

- [Youtube Api documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)

## Obs.:

The API key can be generated [here](https://console.developers.google.com/?pli=1)
